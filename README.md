It does look like the Edinburgh Fringe plays you enjoyed were also successful Kickstarter campaigns, so there is precendent for it.  How all of their goals were below $4,000, so you may consider decreasing the goal amount and reconsiding the expenses.  A reminder that those are:
1. Be Prepared
2. Checkpoint 22
3. Cutting Off Kate Bush
4. Jestia and Raedon
5. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Family
