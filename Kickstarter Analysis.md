# Kickstarter Analysis

## Looking into how Kickstarter campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

### We want to see if there’s an optimal time to launch a campaign, as well as get an understanding of how different goals impact the likelihood of a successful campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- Every month sees more successful campaigns than failed campaigns, and the amount of canceled campaigns is pretty minimal every month
- May, June, and July see a considerable increase in successful campaigns, particularly May.  While December sees the lowest amount of successful campaigns, there's also just less campaigns launched in December in general.
- Failed campaigns see a similar trend as successful campaigns, however the increase in May, June, and July is less drastic.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- The majority of campaigns that are less than $15000 are successful, but the percentages of failed campaigns continues to increase as the goal amount increases
- Almost everything above $45000 fails

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- The main challenge I encountered was in dragging the formulas in the Outcomes Based on Goals. I knew there was a way to be more efficient in keeping the formulas in tact, but I couldn’t remember how so I had to do some Googling
- The other challenge was in confirming that the formulas in the Outcomes Based on Goals sheet were correct.  To spot check I had to do a lot of manual work that seemed to make the quickness of using the formulas a bit moot

## Results


- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Launching a campaign between May and June is more likely to see a successful campaign
2. Launching a campaign in December is not ideal as it’s the only month where the amount of failed campaigns is close to the amount of successful campaigns.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Don't launch anything above a $45000 goal
2. Keeping a campaign below $5000 makes it pretty likely to succeed

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. We don’t know what happened between launch and close.  How were these campaigns marketed and promoted to drive sign ups.  Are there big donors or professional marketers that are impacting successful campaigns
2. We don’t know what other types of funding these plays have.  Is Kickstarter the only funding available


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. I was interested in looking at the average backing amount as well as the amount of backers per month to see if there’s a particular month where people are more generous or have a higher likelihood to back a campaign
2. Continuing to filter down to "plays" and "musicals" within the "theater" parent category could give us better insight, as "spaces" are irrelevant to our campaign and may skew the numbers.
